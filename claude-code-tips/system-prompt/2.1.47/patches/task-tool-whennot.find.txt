When NOT to use the ${CK} tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the ${Aq} or ${ZY} tool instead of the ${CK} tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the ${ZY} tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the ${Aq} tool instead of the ${CK} tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above
